To Do:

Create Player-Offense-Defense Graph using sportsipy player boxscores:
-Has offense and defense node for each player and for each team plus player and team oracle nodes: 2(N + P + 2)
-edges represent either team-team or team-player interaction (player-player edges require higher level dataset eg SportVu for nba

Use both edge and node features in representations.

Use team or subgraph representations to make futures predictions.


Apply ID aware GNNs
-Use for inductive learning (current model is only transductive)


Build Ensemble Model using GNNs with various deep learning approaches (recurrent or temporal attention architectures, Random Forest,etc.)


Improve performance of current models by tuning hyper parameters and optimizing layer choice


Improve Discriminator network for a better interpretation of models predictions.


Analyze GNN models for explainability.
